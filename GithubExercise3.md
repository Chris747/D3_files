#Github Tutorial Part 3

<em>This requires that you have successfully completed the first and second Github exercise. Please see [Part 1](https://github.com/jiwpark00/D3_files/blob/master/GithubExercise1.md)</em> and <em>[Part 2](https://github.com/jiwpark00/D3_files/blob/master/GithubExercise2.md)</em>

In the first lesson, you learned about how to fork a repository, clone it in local drive, and add/commit changes to your repository.
<br>
In the second lesson, you learned how to pull the new changes from the original repository, reflect the changes in your local drive,
and make a note to your own repository.
<br>
In this lesson, you are going to continue to utilize Git but start incorporating some of web foundations to mimic what it feels like an actual workflow.
<br>
There will still be differences given that you are not working with branches within one repository, but as you'll later see, that difference is not hard to understand down the road.

<strong>Step 1</strong> 
<br>
Using the guideline from second lesson, update your local file to obtain this file as well as another folder called Form_Submission (it's inside this repository).
Once you have done that, add, commit, and update your repository.

<strong>Step 2</strong>
<br>
Instead of making a small change in Word, you will now have the ability to work with a real file. In the updated folder, you will see that Form_Submission contain two files: Form_Instruction_1.md and basic_form.html.
View the Github markdown file by visiting this [link](https://github.com/jiwpark00/D3_files/blob/master/Form_Submission/Form_Instruction_1.md).
Your goal is to make the changes described in this, and update your repository. Note that you can check what you are editing real-time by viewing the HTML file in your browser (Chrome or Firefox for instance).

<strong>Step 3</strong>
<br>
As done in first and second lesson, add, commit, and push your change to your repository.

<strong>Step 4</strong>
<br>
This is the new part of this tutorial. Now that you have made some changes, you will want to tell the original developer that, "Hey, I made these cool changes - accept them!"
Essentially, you will be asking the developer to PULL your changes into the original repository.
<br>
To do this, go to the original repository's [link](https://github.com/jiwpark00/D3_files) and click on "New Pull Request".
<br>
Then click on the green button to make a pull request and then email me.
