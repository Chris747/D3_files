#Github Tutorial Part 1

<p>Step 1: You want to fork an existing Github repository to create your own version of the same repository on your Github. </p>
<p>To do this, you need to be logged onto your account on Github and go to my D3 repo <a href="https://github.com/jiwpark00/D3_files">here</a> to fork the repository (you just click the word "Fork" at the top right.</p>

<p>Step 2: After you forked the D3 repo, go to the same D3 repo in your Github (so it should be called https://github.com/yourusername/D3_files). </p>

<p>Step 3: Open Powershell or Bash for Linux and go to the directory of your choice (maybe Documents or Desktop or something that is easily accessible).</p>

<p>Step 4: Type this: "git clone your_D3_repo_URL" without quotations. You get the URL from Step 2 - the URL should look something like https://github.com/yourusername/D3_files.git. Once you do this, you now have a local files of the same repository.</p>

<p>Step 5: Create a text file (like in Wordpad or Microsoft Word) called "I successfully forked and cloned my own repository." and save it in the same directory as your local file (ex. so in Documents or Desktop). </p>

<p>Step 6: Type "git add ." without quotations to stage the file, and then "git commit -m "First-Commit" " without outermost quotations (you want quotations around "First-Commit") to make your commit. </p>

<p>Step 7: Type "git push origin master" and enter the username and password (it'll likely ask for this information) of your Github repository. </p>

<p>Step 8: Once you completed this step, email me. </p>
