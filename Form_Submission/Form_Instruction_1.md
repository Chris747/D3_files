#Form Instructions 1

Now that you have mastered some skills with Git, this is a practice to update some of that with actual work involving HTML and CSS.
Form submission, which you may recall from earlier discussions, is a classic example of HTML. In a simple sense, it is a direct way for the user on the front-end to interact with the server/developer
on the back-end.
To read more about front-end and back-end, refer to this stackoverflow discussion.

In this exercise, you will be responsible for doing several things.
<br>

First, be sure that you have updated your local repository to be reading this file in your computer.
<br>
Second, the working example with some codes already included is in this folder. You can use Chrome or Firefox (or any other browser, really) to view the page.
It is a basic HTML page with a form submission, and upon clicking the Submit button, it gives you an alert box thanks to Javascript.
Your goal is to make this nicer - the locations for improving this page are included in the HTML page.
<br>

Briefly:
<br>
1: You want to give some colors and maybe font changes to this page. Right now, it's pretty dull.
<br>
2: You want to add an introductory paragraph for what the user is submitting the form about. It can be about anything - be creative.
<br>
3: You want to include some visualizations - this can be an image from the web, or D3 graph or Cytoscape graph. Javascript is already running, so if you need jQuery, you'll just need to copy that code in.
<br>
4: Once you are done, be sure to add, commit, and push to your repository.
